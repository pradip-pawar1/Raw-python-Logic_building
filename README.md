# Raw Python Logic-building 🧠

## Overview
This repository is a collection of **pure Python projects** created with the goal of strengthening **problem-solving, logical reasoning, and programming fundamentals** — all without using any external libraries (except where required for specific functionality).

Each project focuses on applying **core Python concepts** such as control flow, functions, data structures, file handling, and later transitions into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  

The repository is continuously evolving as I explore new ideas and convert them into practical mini-projects.

---

## Objectives
- Strengthen logical thinking using raw Python.  
- Understand the step-by-step structure of problem-solving.  
- Gradually transition from procedural coding to OOP.  
- Build real-world simulations through console-based applications.  
- Develop a strong programming foundation before moving to frameworks and data science tools.

## Project List

| Sr. No | Project Name | Description | Link |
| --- |---------------|--------------|------|
| 1 | **Word Guess Game** | Two-player word chain game where each player must form valid words within a time limit. Demonstrates input validation, loops, and condition handling. | [Open](./Word_guess_game/README.md) |
| 2 | **ATM Simulation** | Simulates basic ATM operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking. Reinforces file handling, logic flow, and user interaction. | [Open](./ATM_Simulation/README.md) |
| 3 | **Library Management System** | A simple command-line library system for viewing, borrowing, and returning books. Built using dictionaries and conditional logic. | [Open](./Library_management/README.md) |
| 4 | **Bank Management System (OOP)** | First OOP-based project in the series. Implements account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and updates using class-based design and JSON storage. | [Open](./OPPs_projects/Bank_management/README.md) |
| 5 | **Number Analyser** | Simple python CLI based project which give some description of the number like `Factorial`, `Even/Odd`, `Sum`, `Prime` etc.| [Open](./procedural_programming/05_number_analyzer/)
| 6 | **Vehicle Management System** | A Python-based vehicle showroom management system demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming** principles including **Inheritance** and **Polymorphism** | [Open](./object_oriented_programming/02_vehicle_management/)

## Technical Highlights
- Built entirely using **Core Python (No frameworks)**.  
- Uses **functions, loops, conditionals**, and **exception handling** to simulate real systems.  
- Later projects introduce **classes, objects, and data encapsulation**.  
- Demonstrates the use of **JSON** for persistent storage.  
- Each project is **self-contained** and can be run independently.

## Learning Progression
The structure of this repository reflects my Python learning path:

1. **Procedural Logic Phase** – Developing logical thinking through small, independent programs.  
2. **Functional Phase** – Grouping logic into functions for better organization.  
3. **Object-Oriented Phase** – Building complete systems using classes and encapsulated data.  

Each project adds a new layer of understanding — moving from raw logic to structured program design.

---

## Example Topics Covered
- Loops and Conditional Statements  
- String and Dictionary Operations  
- Functions and Modular Programming  
- File I/O with JSON  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Exception Handling  
- User Interaction via CLI

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pradip-pawar1/Raw-python-Logic_building.git
   ```
2. Navigate into any project folder:
```bash
cd Raw-python-Logic_building/Library_Management_System
```

3. Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Future Roadmap

- Add small AI logic-based projects (e.g., basic chatbots, recommendation demos).
- Integrate file-based authentication systems.
- Expand into data-driven mini projects using Pandas and JSON.
- Continue transitioning toward larger OOP and modular designs.
