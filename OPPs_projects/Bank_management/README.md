# Bank Management System (OOP Project)

## Overview
The **Bank Management System** is a console-based Python project built using the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** approach.  
It simulates a simple digital banking system that allows users to create accounts, deposit or withdraw money, view account details, update information, and delete accounts.

This is the **first OOP project** in the **Raw Python Logic-building** series, designed to shift from procedural thinking to structured, class-based design.

---

## Features
- Account creation with age and PIN verification  
- Unique account number generation  
- Deposit and withdrawal with balance checks  
- View full user details  
- Update account information (Name, Email, PIN)  
- Delete account with confirmation  
- Data persistence using JSON file (`data.json`)  

---

## Core Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept | How It‚Äôs Used |
|----------|----------------|
| **Class and Object** | `Bank` class defines the structure; `user = Bank()` creates the instance. |
| **Class Variables** | `database` and `data` shared across all instances. |
| **Class Methods** | `__update()` and `__accountgenerate()` are used for database handling and account creation. |
| **Encapsulation** | Internal data management handled via private methods (`__update`). |
| **Exception Handling** | Prevents runtime crashes during file reading and input errors. |
| **File Handling (JSON)** | Saves and retrieves data from `data.json` for persistent storage. |

---

## Project Flow

1. **Initialization**  
   The program checks if the database file (`data.json`) exists. If it does, existing user data is loaded.

2. **Menu Options**  
   Upon execution, the user is presented with options:
```
    Press 1: Create Account
    Press 2: Deposit money
    Press 3: Withdraw money
    Press 4: View details
    Press 5: Update details
    Press 6: Delete account
```

3. **Account Creation**
- Collects user details such as name, age, email, and 4-digit PIN.  
- Automatically generates a unique alphanumeric account number.  
- Validates eligibility (must be 18+ with a valid 4-digit PIN).  
- Saves the user data into `data.json`.

4. **Depositing Money**
- User enters account number and PIN for verification.  
- Allows deposits up to ‚Çπ10,000 per transaction.  
- Updates and saves new balance in the database.

5. **Withdrawing Money**
- Ensures sufficient balance before withdrawal.  
- Updates balance after successful transaction.

6. **Viewing Account Details**
- Displays full account details including name, balance, and account number.

7. **Updating User Information**
- Allows changing name, email, or PIN.  
- Restricts modification of age, account number, or balance.  
- Reflects all updates in `data.json`.

8. **Deleting an Account**
- Confirms user intent before deletion.  
- Removes user data permanently from the file.

## Code Explanation

### Class Definition
```python
class Bank:
 database = 'Bank_management/data.json'
 data = []
```
Defines the Bank class with a shared database path and data container.
---

### Database Handling
```python
if Path(database).exists():
    with open(database) as fs:
        data = json.loads(fs.read())
```
Checks for the existing database and loads all account information.
---

### Account Creation
```python
def createaccount(self):
    info = {
        "Name": input("Enter your name: "),
        "Age": int(input("Enter your age: ")),
        "Email": input("Enter Your Email: "),
        "Pin": int(input("Enter you pin (4 digit): ")),
        "AccountNo.": Bank.__accountgenerate(),
        "Balance": 0
    }
```
Takes user inputs, validates them, generates an account number, and stores data persistently.
---

### Deposit and Withdrawal

- Both methods (depositMoney, withrawlMoney) perform:
- Account and PIN verification
- Validation of amount limits
- Balance updates followed by saving data to JSON
---

### Updating Account Details

Allows partial modification:
```python
"Name": input("Enter new name or enter to skip: "),
"Email": input("Enter the new email or enter to skip: "),
"Pin": input("Enter new pin or enter to skip: ")
```
---

### Data Persistence

Every change is written to the JSON file through:
```python
with open(cls.database, 'w') as fs:
    fs.write(json.dumps(Bank.data))
```
---

### Example Run
```yaml
Press 1: Create Account
Press 2: Deposit money
Press 3: Withdraw money
Press 4: View details
Press 5: Update details
Press 6: Delete account

Enter your choice: 1

Please provide your info:
Enter your name: Pradip
Enter your age: 20
Enter Your Email: pradip@example.com
Enter your pin (4 digit): 1234

Account created successfully
Please note your Account No.
```

### Project Structure
```bach
üìÅ Bank Management System (OOP)
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bank_app.py            # Main Python script
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data.json              # Stores all user data
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Project documentation
```
---

### How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the file:
```
python main.py
```
---

### Future Improvements

- Implement transaction history.
- Add login session system.
- Support for interest calculation.
- Improved validation and error messages.
- Option to export account statements.

Would you like me to **append an ‚ÄúOOP Learning Reflection‚Äù** section at the end (e.g., what you learned about class methods, encapsulation, etc.) ‚Äî written in your tone, so it looks natural in your repo?  
It‚Äôll make the README feel personal and educational.
